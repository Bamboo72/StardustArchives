<meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; "></head><body><div class="moz-text-html" lang="x-unicode"><div dir="auto"><div dir="auto">Heyyyyyy guess who's actually on top of it for once?!😉😅 Hello my Jacob, my one and only Stardust!!🥰 How are you? Did you get your package? Hopefully you did and hopefully you like it. But you can tell me if you don't, no worries😎😅</div><div dir="auto">Anyways, thank you so much for the flowers and the letter!! I like the Angel Moroni coins too😂☺️ but awwww, you are so sweet and thoughtful and I am so so blessed to be yours! You are so good at making me happy🥰 I love you so much, forever and always!🤟</div><div dir="auto">Hence the title, I'm feeling really sick right now🫤 My stomach has been hurting me everytime I eat so then I don't eat but then I'm cold and shaky because I didn't eat so then I eat but then my stomach hurts😑 It's a super lame and vicious cycle</div><div dir="auto">Also, my phone updated and now all of the emojis look super weird and I don't like it😒</div><div dir="auto"><br></div><div dir="auto">Anyway, here's the week😅</div><div dir="auto"><br></div>Monday:<div dir="auto">- Got almost everything done today!!😎</div><div dir="auto">- Planned and then journaled the first half of the week real quick😅</div><div dir="auto">- Got ready and almost left before 8, it was only 7:56 but we still waited in the apartment like good little missionaries should😂</div><div dir="auto">- Shopping which included buying some Pokemon cards and some spray glue😅</div><div dir="auto">- Working on your Pokemon cards which was very stressful because I was using spray glue and it's just so unpredictable. I had some trial runs too so now we have 2 blank Pokemon cards</div><div dir="auto">- During this time there was a knock on our door, which was like weird because ummm who's knocking on our door? But we opened it and there was a man standing there with a flower delivery for Ainsley😮 I brought it in and while the handwriting was foreign, I immediately recognized your voice in the note!! Jacob! That is so so sweet of you! You have no idea how happy you've made me🥰 I was assembling your package during this time but I don't know if what I get you will be what you necessarily want. I tried to show my love but apparently I can only do that by buying trinkets and candy😅😅😅 I really hope you like it though. I love you!!🥰</div><div dir="auto">- Asked the ZLs to leave the area to go to Hobby Lobby, waited an hour and they hadn't responded still, so we figured they'd approve it while we traveled there... they didn't until 3 hours later, and then we got a bit of chastisement for not being more persistent with our asking😅😔</div><div dir="auto">- We went to the Dollar Store, Hobby Lobby, and GameStop! It was all so much fun, especially Hobby Lobby! I got some card sleeves and also found a very adorable duck to add to my collection. Being in GameStop was so weird. I kept seeing all of these cool games I want to play, and apparently they're coming out with a Princess Peach game that's kind of similar to Mario Odyssey, or that's what it looked like from the picture anyway. But yeah, it was fun and Sister Richards really liked being there and there was a ton of Squishmallows, but it didn't really feel right to be there right now, if that makes sense.&nbsp;</div><div dir="auto">- We got stuck in a TON of traffic on the way home</div><div dir="auto">- Grabbed Sonic for lunch😋</div><div dir="auto">- Dr. Appointment</div><div dir="auto">- Finished packages and mailed them, finished journaling, finally talked to my family</div><div dir="auto">- Contacts</div><div dir="auto">- Bulverde MCC</div><div dir="auto">- Home!</div><div dir="auto">- During the Monday night call, President Fitzgerald got very stern and said that he was very disappointed in those who watched the Superbowl last night. I sure was glad that wasn't us, and much happier that it didn't even cross my mind to do that! But he also said that Pokemon and other trading card games should only be played on Pdays. He said to not even sort or look at the cards unless on Pday. So I guess that puts an end on my career of making custom Pokemon cards (for now😉)</div><div dir="auto"><br></div><div dir="auto">Tuesday:</div><div dir="auto">- We went to Provisions and had a good interaction with Bread Lady! She even gave us a hug at the end!! The trick is to just not care where she puts things and just completely let her win😅 But hey, it made it a happier work environment😂 Also we ended up leaving with a bunch of bananas because Pete saw us leaving with nothing and insisted we take some bananas. Neither Sister Richards or I like bananas...😅😅😅</div><div dir="auto">- We had our studies and lunch which was very nice. I'm working on drawing the Jesus hands drawing again but on a bigger piece of paper. Kind of funny that hands are what I struggle with drawing the most and yet I always end up focusing on those in my projects😅 I just like hands I guess😄 Also I just had some edamame and leftover chicken strips and fries from Chilis😅</div><div dir="auto">- PS. Don't have an existential crisis about writing down everything you eat. It brings me joy to read☺️😂</div><div dir="auto">- We had our tech call and then I had therapy....😑 I still hate it and it's super awkward that it was with Brother Valdez who is literally in Spring Branch ward and we talk to him all the time but whatever, basically the conversation went just as I thought it was. He just went oh you're doing fine now! Well we'll meet a couple more times to make sure you're still fine and then you're free😁 Not ideal but I am super happy that the new medication has helped me get back to "normal"😅</div><div dir="auto">- Lots of contacts and we found out that Charlene and everyone is sick so we may not be able to meet tomorrow😔 Darn cedar fever!!!</div><div dir="auto">- We had dinner with the Nemeths which was an adventure😅 Sister Nemethmade us hamburgers which was so kind of her, and they were good! Her kids do not listen to her at all though, which is honestly so sad. Parenting seems so hard😣 Also we were out of there in half an hour😅 Also also we did the can smash activity for them and I did it wrong so my finger was hurting😅 But they didn't notice and so they didn't need to know🤫😅</div><div dir="auto">- We had a quick lesson with the Sodenkamps where we did can smash again because it seemed right. My finger hurts but I'm sure it will be fiiiiiiine😁😅</div><div dir="auto">- We went to Young Women's in Spring Branch and joined their Valentine party! We made homemade pizzas and decorated cupcakes, and the girls danced to Just Dance songs. It was fun and we just talked with Analiyah the whole time😛</div><div dir="auto">- Homeo</div><div dir="auto">- Oh I got your letter today!!! And oh my goodness it was so sweet!! I appreciate you being concerned about me having to lug things around, and it makes me feel kind of bad that I just sent you a bunch more things to lug around😅😅😅 I loved the poem on the back, and I think a lot about the moment when we'll embrace again🥰 But I'm going to make this mission the best I can make it!</div><div dir="auto">- also I got to read your email today! I loved it so much, and it really touched me with all the details you included🥰 I'm going to try and do better at that from now on😅 Also Sister Richards and I watched the video you made and we found it very amusing😂 You're such a dork and I'm so glad you are mine🥰🥰🥰</div><div dir="auto"><br></div><div dir="auto">Wednesday:</div><div dir="auto">Happy Valentines Day my love! How grateful I am for another year of being yours, and I am so much more grateful that this is our final Valentines Day apart🥰 I thought about you a lot today but I decided that just like you, I am going to make this the best mission I can make it! Then I'll have no regrets and a lot more stories for when we are finally reunited🥰</div><div dir="auto">Today is also my one year anniversary of being in Texas! It's crazy to think that I've already been out in the field for a year, but it also feels like I've been doing this forever and I'm kind of afraid for the day when I have to take my tag off... But it's fine, we just won't think about that😅</div><div dir="auto">- Typical morning</div><div dir="auto">- District council!! (Unlike yours, mine did not turn into a surprise Valentine day party😂 But I did get a tender mercy from the Lord! The ZLs visited to give a training and it was all about how to find joy in the work, or how to endure well!! They talked a lot about gratitude and searching for the Spirit and I'm so excited to try the tips out! This is just the answer I've been looking for!!)</div><div dir="auto">- Lunch (I honestly don't remember what it is, I'm sorry😅)</div><div dir="auto">- We did a lot of contacts, Rick texted us back and broke up with us😭 and we made a TON of hearts for heart attacks today!! Because what else would Sister missionaries do on Valentines day?!😂</div><div dir="auto">- We had a very awkward and kind of sad lesson with the Williams family. Their family is very broken right now😔 But we shared Luke 12:6-7 and talked about how Heavenly Father loves everything He has created, with His children being at the top of the list! Brother Williams really appreciated the message. Valentines Day is a very hard day for those who are in broken relationships😔</div><div dir="auto">- We started our heart attacks! Annnnnnd we only got caught by 3 of them😅😅😅</div><div dir="auto">- While on our way to Charlene's door, it opened and we tried to book it, but then we realized it's literally midday so they're going to know who it is, so we went back.😂 Jasmine was there and was so happy to see us. She gave us a huge smile and started saying "heyyyyyy🥰" but then we were like "Jasmine no go back in we're trying to heart attack you" so then she went "ohhhhhhh" and pulled the door shut but left it open a crack so she could still watch us put the hearts up. It was so funny😂</div><div dir="auto">- We heart attacked the Calls and they have a huge window right before the door that the kids saw us through. So as we were getting into the car and starting it, we heard "CAUGHT YOU" from the yard and turned to see Quinn pointing his finger at us. And then Landon blew us a kiss as we drove away😅😅😅😂</div><div dir="auto">- We heart attacked Sister Calderwood's house and before we got back to the car, we heard a loud and mean "HEY" that made me jump and scream😅 It was just Sister Calderwood trying to be funny but she felt bad that she scared me😂😂😂 But yeah, she said thank you for the hearts😂</div><div dir="auto">- Other things we saw during our heart attack excursion:&nbsp;</div><div dir="auto">☆A three legged deer</div><div dir="auto">☆A live possum playing dead on the road😳</div><div dir="auto">☆The hanging deer sign that Sister Richards has been looking for forever😂</div><div dir="auto">☆A kid beating up a "children crossing" sign and being very happy about doing so😅</div><div dir="auto">- After this, we went to the Valentines for a Valentine dinner! It was a lot of fun and the food was great! Sister Valentine is pretty dang good at cooking tamales😋 They were mostly old members so they all just complained about HOAs and taxes together while we had no idea what was going on😅 Also there were some inactive members there and one of them openly confessed a crime?? I guess he did something to tamper his diesel truck to make it go faster and he that's technically illegal?? Soooooo yeah, don't know what to do there😅😅😅</div><div dir="auto">- Annnnnnnd then we went home!</div><div dir="auto"><br></div><div dir="auto">Thursday:</div><div dir="auto">- Today I did 75 "perfect form" situps which was very exhausting but I was proud of myself😅</div><div dir="auto">- We helped Sister Thiele sort through pictures and photos for two hours. She has SO MANY PICTURES😅🫠 It was fun, we weren't able to get much up on the walls since it was just sorting, but she said it helped a lot. Also her husband Pat kept coming in to chat with us or tell us stories and Sister Thiele was being really passive with him and shutting him down. She told us, "It's okay, he married me," but it still just felt so sad. I hope that I don't get to that point with anyone, just constantly nitpicking. 😔&nbsp;</div><div dir="auto">- We came home and had lunch, which was a smoothie featuring the odds and ends of our fridge. It had a base of oat milk plus a splash of regular milk, some frozen bananas and strawberries, some old Cool Whip and some honey. The result? It tasted like oat milk with honey😅 I added a kiwi strawberry Propel packet to it and then it tasted a lot better!😋😅</div><div dir="auto">- Weekly Planning was pretty good today! It's kind of crazy because we lost 2 recent converts this week to timing out, so it took a lot less time than usual😅 Also we set some great goals!!🥳</div><div dir="auto">- We had a 15 minute comp study and then a 15 minute contacts 😅</div><div dir="auto">- We had dinner with the Seagos! They're so cute and sweet! They were asking us the whole time about how the Kennedy family is doing! Also they made chicken fajitas and they were delicious😋 Top that all off with petting their very old chocolate Lab, and it was a very good visit🥰</div><div dir="auto">- Then we officially began our mini mission, take 2!!🥳 We'll have Aylee with us for the next few days, which is so exciting because she's so sweet! She's super friendly and willing to talk, and we got to know a lot about her in the short drive over to the RS activity! Also she drives a big red truck, so we're traveling in style for the next 2 days😎🛻</div><div dir="auto">- RS activity</div><div dir="auto">- Dropped Aylee off at the Davises</div><div dir="auto">- Came home and crashed HARD😴</div><div dir="auto"><br></div><div dir="auto">Friday:</div><div dir="auto">Well, today started off crazy and ended very differently than we planned</div><div dir="auto">- We drove over to the Davises first thing to meet up with Aylee!</div><div dir="auto">- For exercise, we walked around the neighborhood with reflective jackets and also Brother Davis as our guard because he insisted😂</div><div dir="auto">- Got ready there and had waffles for breakfast😋</div><div dir="auto">- Personal study (I looked into marriage in the Old Testament a lot since that's what Charlene had questions on)</div><div dir="auto">- Comp study and weekly report at the church</div><div dir="auto">- We finally got a lesson scheduled with Desteny today!!!!🥳 Annnnnd then she canceled two hours later😅😅😅</div><div dir="auto">- We had a lesson with Analiyah! We went over the Baptism interview questions and she answered them all well! She was being more shy and reserved today since we had Aylee with us, but her younger brother Iker absolutely loved having another sister missionary to pay attention to him😂 Also they were all tying balloon animals so that made it difficult for Analiyah and us to hear each other😂</div><div dir="auto">- We had our packed lunch at the church. I was a little worried because of the smell, but Brother Davis made us some delicious chicken salad sandwiches!😋&nbsp;</div><div dir="auto">- For the rest of lunch, Sister Richards and Aylee wanted to nap, so we went into the chapel but as soon as we laid down, a worker came in and that was mega awkward😅 Sooooo we went to the mothers lounge instead😂</div><div dir="auto">- I finished my slideshow for the Facebook training while Aylee and Sister Richards made hearts</div><div dir="auto">- We helped one member sort through all of her papers to find the files that she needs for her divorce...😬 She's also trying to sue like 5 different places at once?? So yeah, that was interesting and we got to hear some tea😅</div><div dir="auto">- We visited Mary!! She's doing good and was so excited to read our kids BOM story today. She also said the sweetest prayer at the end and Aylee absolutely loved her🥰</div><div dir="auto">- Sister Richards started not feeling good at this point but insisted that she'd be fine. We made a quick stop at the gas station for some carbonation just in case though. I do love me a cherry Sprite😋</div><div dir="auto">- We had dinner with Sister Nessen which was a little awkward but good! She really likes having us over so we're happy to be there. We had French toast and eggs for dinner and it was very tasty! Also her 3yo entertained us by being very naughty😅😬 Oh and they had the CUTEST German Shepherd! She was so crazy and hyper but I love her😂</div><div dir="auto">- We drove up to Blanco to heart attack Karen and the Williams! Karen told us we couldn't come see her because she's dealing with family problems😔 So we decided that she needed to feel some love! Since Sister Richards wasn't up to it, she rolled down the window and Aylee and I performed the heat attacks. We got some personal heart attacks of our own as we were at Karen's door. We weren't caught, but a bird flew out of the wreath RIGHT in front of our faces!! That was honestly terrifying but all in all it was so much fun!</div><div dir="auto">- We came back to the Davises and Sister Richards completely crashed. I finally convinced her that she needed to go home and rest, so we arranged for Aylee to spend the rest of her mini mission with the STLs and then I took Sister Richards home. I feel so bad because she didn't want to say anything and now she's pushed herself to a point of exhaustion. I'm glad the Spirit prompted me to finally notice though. 😔</div><div dir="auto">- We went home and went straight to bed. I really hope this helps her feel better tomorrow!</div><div dir="auto"><br></div><div dir="auto">Saturday:</div><div dir="auto">Well not much has happened today... Sister Richards woke up this morning still feeling so sick, so we canceled everything and hunkered down. She's been doing a lot of sleeping and I've been doing a lot of journaling😅&nbsp;</div><div dir="auto">The one thing we did do today was meet with Charlene and her family over video call! It ended up being really good and we had some great discussions about Nephi leaving and about how Leah and Rachel are perhaps a little competitive😅 We also ended up talking about polygamy and it went really well! Okay, I'm saying "we" but it was really me because Sister Richards was my moral support from the couch while I taught the lesson😂 We invited them to read the BoM every day, even if it was just for 5 minutes, and they said they would!!</div><div dir="auto">We left the house at the very end of the day to do my Facebook training and also get some Taco Bell. Heads up, their quesadillas are NOT good😕</div><div dir="auto"><br></div><div dir="auto">Sunday:</div><div dir="auto">Today was also very slow, but not until after church😂</div><div dir="auto">Church was crazy! We had three people we didn't just randomly walk through the doors in Spring Branch ward! One of them was a nonmember, but he didn't want to meet with us yet😅 We gave him a card with our number anyway though! The other two were DNCs but hopefully they're coming back to church now! So exciting!&nbsp;</div><div dir="auto">Analiyah had her baptismal interview today and it went well! As we expected, she got super quiet with Elder Anderson and insisted that we come with her. She gave good answers though! She's a good kid🥰</div><div dir="auto">Charlene, Virginia, and Zander came to church today! Zander told us he wants to get a suit for church so that's so cute! Charlene also said that Jesse downloaded the Gospel Library app and she is so excited! He may be coming to church next week, so pray for him!!🙏 Also we rescheduled our baptism logistics lesson for Monday!🥳</div><div dir="auto">Then we came home and Sister Richards crashed for the rest of the day. I kind of crashed with her, my stomach has been killing me these last few days and I don't know why... super annoying though.&nbsp;</div><div dir="auto">We went to the church at the end of the day to do the Facebook training again, and then we came home and went back to bed😂</div><div dir="auto"><br></div><div dir="auto"><br></div><div dir="auto">My Answers for You!!😘</div><div dir="auto"><br></div><div dir="auto">"What's been your favorite area?"</div><div dir="auto">I would say Boerne, but I don't know now because Bulverde is definitely approaching that position! I guess I just really like the Hill Country😂 But I really love the hills and the trees and the wind and the rain, and I also love covering multiple wards, getting to know so many members, having someone new to talk to each day, and having so many good friends and watching them grow! I think I'm honestly just judging the areas off of the people I like there😅 But I would probably still say Boerne because there's a lot more to do there and a lot more places to eat and there's apartment complexes to knock😅 But yeah, Hill Cantera Zone is the place to be😎</div><div dir="auto"><br></div><div dir="auto">"Who's been your favorite companion?"</div><div dir="auto">Ooooh, that's a hard one... I think I'd still say it's Sister Brough, but I have also grown with and loved all (or most😅) of my companions! Sister Ensign and Sister Richards are definitely also in the running for favorite companion. Oh and Sister Lyons😅 I felt like I could truly be myself with them and help each other grow! I'm definitely going to stay in touch with most of my comps after the mission, and at least Sister Brough is going to be one of my bridesmaids when it gets to that point😂</div><div dir="auto"><br></div><div dir="auto">"What's been your favorite gift from me? (Or top 5 favorites)"</div><div dir="auto">Hmmmmmmmm... yeah I'm going to have to say top 5😅</div><div dir="auto">1. The forget-me-not necklace!! I have worn it every day since you gave it to me and it helps me feel connected to you, even when we're so far away!&nbsp;</div><div dir="auto">2.  The Book of Remembrance😍 You put so much thought into it and it still makes me cry to read through it. We had so many happy memories together, and yet everytime I get to your Testimony page I am reminded that everything we are doing is so worth it🥰</div><div dir="auto">3. Your jacket and hoodie🥰 That was so sweet of you to give to me and they make me feel so happy and safe every time I hold them🥰</div><div dir="auto">4. The stardust in a jar and the frozen in time flowers! They were so beautiful and when I read the continuation of our poem, they became so much more beautiful. We can try to lock up the good memories, but we can also trust in the Lord that He will continue to watch over us so we can make new memories🥰</div><div dir="auto">5. Ah can I just say 15 other things in this one??😅😅😅 I love Elder Gnome, the love scriptures from last Valentines Day, the fragile heart boi (who you'll be pleased to hear is still doing well💖), the kalimba, and Snuggles and the Snoopy Squishmallow!! Goodness it's too hard to pick, so I think I'm not going to😉 Thank you for all that you've done to show your love for me!! I love you so so much!!🤟🫶</div><div dir="auto"><br></div><div dir="auto">"Where do you want to go on vacation someday?"</div><div dir="auto">I know this is basic, but I'd really like to go on vacation to our missions!! I think it would be so fun to do that at some point in our lives! But as for a foreign place, I think it would be SO cool to go to Iceland!🤩</div><div dir="auto"><br></div><div dir="auto">"What are your top 3 favorite beverages?"</div><div dir="auto">I'll exclude water from this list, even though that is by far my mostest favorite drink😋😅</div><div dir="auto">1. The Piña Colada smoothie from Orange Julius😋</div><div dir="auto">2. Dr. Pepper Cream Soda😍</div><div dir="auto">3. Okay this one is technically water but not actually!! I did this all the time at Kneaders, but you fill up a cup of cold water and add a shot of Sprite to it. It makes it bubbly and sweeter than sparkling water, but it's not overpowering like soda tends to be. 10/10 top hydration tip 😝</div></div>
